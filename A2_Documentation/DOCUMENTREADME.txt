BEFORE WRITING ANYTHING, MAKE SURE YOU DO THE FOLLOWING:
Make sure you are on the "No Spacing" option. (Refer to nospacingpicture.png) 
All font must be calibri (body) size 12.
Line spacing must also be size 12.
Bold any titles and make them size 18 (sub headings) and size 24 (main headings).

These NEED to be help for me to be able to compile all of the documentation into one big one.
